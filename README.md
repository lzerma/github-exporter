# JIRASYNC

The idea behind this pseudo-project is in the not too far future create a plugin which could be used to sync github and JIRA.

## Installing
- Run `npm install`
- Export the env var `GITHUB_BEARER` with the bearer from your github account.
- On file `.src/main.ts` on the `bootstrap` function, replace the placeholder **yourprojecthere** with the Github organization.
- Run `npm start` and wait for the file be generated under the root folder.
